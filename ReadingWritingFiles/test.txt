A text file (sometimes spelled "textfile": an old alternative name is "flatfile")
 is a kind of computer file that is structured as a sequence of lines of electronic text.
  A text file exists within a computer file system. The end of a text file is often denoted
   by placing one or more special characters, known as an end-of-file marker, after the last line in a text file. Such markers were required under the CP/M and MS-DOS operating systems. On modern operating systems such as Windows or Linux, text files do not contain any special EOF character.

"Text file" refers to a type of container, while plain text refers to a type of content.
 Text files can contain plain text, but they are not limited to such.

At a generic level of description, there are two kinds of computer files:
 text files and binary files.[1]
 Because of their simplicity, text files are commonly used for storage of information.
  They avoid some of the problems encountered with other file formats, such as endianness,
   padding bytes, or differences in the number of bytes in a machine word. Further, when 
   data corruption occurs in a text file, it is often easier to recover and continue processing 
   the remaining contents. A disadvantage of text files is that they usually have a low entropy,
    meaning that the information occupies more storage than is strictly necessary.

A simple text file needs no additional metadata to assist the reader in interpretation,
 and therefore may contain no data at all, which is a case of zero byte file.
 
 
 The ASCII character set is the most common format for English-language text files, and is generally assumed to be the default file format in many situations. For accented and other non-ASCII characters, it is necessary to choose a character encoding. In many systems, this is chosen on the basis of the default locale setting on the computer it is read on. Common character encodings include ISO 8859-1 for many European languages.

Because many encodings have only a limited repertoire of characters,
they are often only usable to represent text in a limited subset of human 
languages. Unicode is an attempt to create a common standard for representing
 all known languages, and most known character sets are subsets of the very larg
 e Unicode character set. Although there are multiple character encodings available
  for Unicode, the most common is UTF-8, which has the advantage of being backwards-compatible
   with ASCII; that is, every ASCII text file is also a UTF-8 text file with identical meaning.
   
   On most operating systems the name text file refers to file format that allows only plain text content with very little formatting (e.g., no bold or italic types). Such files can be viewed and edited on text terminals or in simple text editors. Text files usually have the MIME type "text/plain", usually with additional information indicating an encoding.
